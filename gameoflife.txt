cells = []
nextcells = copy of cells

V

for every cell, update(cells)
--> look around at neighbors in cells, change state in next_cells
accordingly

then for every cell, re-draw based on next_cells

V

Now, cells is unchanged and next_cells is the new generation, so
do:

cells = nextcells

then, repeat
